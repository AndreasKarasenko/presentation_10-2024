This repository contains the presentation slides, codes, and datasets presented in the talk.
Below you will also find a brief overview of the topics covered, as well as links to the different sections.


### Overview
The talk is focused around practical machine applications in data driven marketing with a focus on unstructured data (e.g. reviews) and (large) language models (LLM).
It is meant to provide an introduction to how LLMs work, where their strenghts lie, how they are used in marketing (and beyond), and how you can use them yourself.

To ensure data privacy and allow for usage in critical industries the talk uses only locally running LLMs.
You will learn how to install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), download and serve LLMs on your own hardware, and use them for various text processing tasks.
